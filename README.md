# Car Dheko - Used Car Price Prediction

## Introduction

"Car Dheko - Used Car Price Prediction" is a project aimed at predicting the prices of used cars based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to provide accurate price predictions, assisting buyers and sellers in making informed decisions in the used car market.

## Overview

The project includes the following key components:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model development
- Price prediction
- Model evaluation
- Deployment using Streamlit

## Features

**Data Cleaning:** Removes duplicates, handles missing values, and transforms data types.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizes data distributions and relationships among features.

**Model Development:** Trains various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and more.

**Price Prediction:** Inputs car features to predict the price of a used car.

**User-Friendly Interface:** Streamlit application provides an interactive user experience.



## Technologies Used

### Programming Language:

**Python:** The primary programming language used for data analysis, machine learning, and developing the Streamlit application.

**Data Handling and Analysis:**

**Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis, including data cleaning and preprocessing.

**NumPy:** For numerical computations and handling arrays.
Data Visualization:

**Matplotlib:** For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

**Seaborn:** For statistical data visualization based on Matplotlib, making it easier to create attractive graphs.
Machine Learning:

**Scikit-learn:** A library for implementing machine learning algorithms, including regression models, decision trees, and model evaluation metrics.

**XGBoost:** For gradient boosting and ensemble learning, often used to improve prediction accuracy.
Web Framework:

**Streamlit:** For building the web application that allows users to input car features and receive price predictions interactively.

## Future Improvements

**Model Optimization:**

Experiment with advanced machine learning algorithms (e.g., LightGBM, CatBoost) and perform hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction accuracy.
Implement ensemble methods to combine multiple models for better performance.

**Feature Engineering:**

Explore additional features such as service history, accident history, and owner details to improve prediction accuracy.
Create new features through techniques like polynomial feature expansion or interaction terms between existing features.

**User Interface Enhancements:**

Improve the Streamlit application interface with better design elements, user guidance, and input validation.
Allow users to upload a CSV file containing multiple car entries for batch predictions.

**Deployment and Accessibility:**

Deploy the application on cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, or Google Cloud to make it accessible to a wider audience.
Implement a RESTful API to allow other applications to access the price prediction functionality.

**Data Collection:**

Set up a web scraping mechanism to automatically update the dataset with the latest used car listings and prices.
Use APIs from car sales platforms to fetch real-time data.

**Model Interpretability:**

Integrate model interpretation tools like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to help users understand the predictions.
Provide visualizations that explain the model's decision-making process.

**User Feedback Mechanism:**

Implement a feedback system to allow users to report inaccuracies in predictions, helping to refine the model over time.
Use this feedback to retrain the model periodically.

**Multi-language Support:**

Add support for multiple languages to cater to a broader audience, making the application more accessible.

**Mobile Application Development:**

Develop a mobile app version of the prediction tool to reach users who prefer mobile devices.

**Extended Analytics:**

Include additional analytics features, such as trends in car prices, regional price differences, and historical data comparisons.
Provide insights on market conditions and economic factors affecting used car prices.
